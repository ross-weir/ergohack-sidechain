SigmaChains refactoring plan
============================

This document outlines changes needed for reusing possibilities of Ergo's contractual layer (Sigma), peer-to-peer 
and consensus-related functionalities (such as Autolykos) in different environments, such as:

* offchain contractual environments (such as offchain cash)
* merged-mined sidechains
* dedicated sigmachains (with trustless pegging)
